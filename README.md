# Google Drive API
These are two stand alone console based application developed for uploading and downloading files to Google Drive from software 
by executing appropriate executable file with proper command line arguments.

Here, I've used Google Drive API to transfer files. Downloading files from Google Drive Module is in C#.NET and Uploading files to Google Drive Module is in VB.NET.
