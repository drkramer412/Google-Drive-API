# Google Drive API
These are two stand alone console based application developed for uploading and downloading files to Google Drive from software 
by executing appropriate executable file with proper command line arguments.

Basically these two modules are used to take backup of software(Products of RavitechWorld) database at google drives. And used to restore the backup to system form drive.


Here, I've used Google Drive API to transfer files. Downloading files from Google Drive Module is in C#.NET and Uploading files to Google Drive Module is in VB.NET.
